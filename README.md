# Task 5 – Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis using Python to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the Titanic dataset.

## 📂 Files Included
- EDA_Titanic.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)
- Titanic Dataset (titanic.csv)
- PDF Report (EDA_Report.pdf)
- README.md

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset and performed info(), describe(), value_counts()
2. Checked missing values and cleaned them
3. Univariate analysis (histograms, countplots)
4. Bivariate analysis (gender vs survival, class vs survival)
5. Multivariate analysis (pairplot, heatmap)
6. Insights extracted and documented

## 📈 Charts Included
- Age Histogram  
- Survival Countplot  
- Gender vs Survival  
- Class vs Survival  
- Age Boxplot  
- Pairplot  
- Correlation Heatmap  

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Females survived far more than males  
- 1st class passengers had highest survival rate  
- Higher fare → higher survival probability  
- 3rd class males had lowest survival  
- Age alone is not a strong survival indicator  

## 🏁 Conclusion
The EDA shows strong patterns in survival based on gender, class, and fare, revealing social and economic influences on Titanic survival outcomes.
